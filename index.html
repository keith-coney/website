          <h1>Keith Coney Life Support</h1>
          <h2>Helping people overcome adversity.</h2>

          <p>
          Keith Coney is a chartered engineer and chartered project manager, an accredited life coach and an accredited lead auditor. He works full time as Quality Manager for a tier 1 contractor on a major Defence contract. In his spare time he successfully speaks to people suffering alcoholism, anxiety and panic attacks, major depression, bipolar, sexual abuse, suicide attempts, grief, people with multiple disorders as well as coaching people not experiencing mental illness.
          </p>
          <p>
          Keith has no training in mental illness with the exception of a mental health first aid course and a great deal of person experience. Keith has experienced 4 mental illnesses including the suicide of his father, a long bipolar episode, psychosis and strong anxiety. Keith considers himself as having recovered several years ago from these illnesses and now experiences the benefits of bipolar.
          </p>  
          <p>
          Despite previously having a strong fear of public speaking, Keith has grown to embrace his experiences and has now spoken to the following organisations in groups of up to 300 people: RAAF 35 SQN, Conrad Gargett Architects, Sunsuper with applications pending for others including TED talks.   
          </p>
          <p>
          Keith is more open about mental illness than most people will be ready for. With that said his experience makes him sensitive of other’s reactions to what might be unpleasant details. He advocates for education by large corporates on the recognition of mental illnesses..
          </p>

          <h3>How does mental health support work?</h3>
          <p>Keith works with anxiety and bipolar support currently. A free initial discussion allows you and Keith to confirm the support will work for you. By entering your details below, Keith can contact you after hours. Pricing varies depending  on circumstances. Mental health support by a person with lived experience is a rare offering. Please treat Keith as you would like to be treated - with care and consideration. All discussions should not exceed one hour. For support to work it's important to show a willingness to get better. Thank you.</p>
          
          <h3>How does coaching work?</h3>
          <p>Coaching is for people looking to extend their capabilities by removing road blocks in the way of a more effective life. Coaching is based on Ontology, the study of a person's BEING. Initially you answer 250 questions which evaluate your being and provide a profile of 31 aspects - courage, fear, assertiveness, awareness, integrity, proactivity etc. </p>
          <p>The profile identifies areas for you and Keith to discuss and prioritise before completing a contract and commencing coaching. Keith requires 2hrs for your profile feedback.</p>
