          <h1>Keith Coney Life Support</h1>
          <h2>Helping people overcome adversity.</h2>

          <p>
          Keith Coney is a chartered engineer and chartered project manager, an accredited life coach and an accredited lead auditor. He works full time as Quality Manager for a tier 1 contractor on a major Defence contract. In his spare time he successfully speaks to people suffering alcoholism, anxiety and panic attacks, major depression, bipolar, sexual abuse, suicide attempts, grief, people with multiple disorders as well as coaching people not experiencing mental illness.
          </p>
          <p>
          Keith has no training in mental illness with the exception of a mental health first aid course and a great deal of person experience. Keith has experienced 4 mental illnesses including the suicide of his father, a long bipolar episode, psychosis and strong anxiety. Keith considers himself as having recovered several years ago from these illnesses and now experiences the benefits of bipolar.
          </p>  
          <p>
          Despite previously having a strong fear of public speaking, Keith has grown to embrace his experiences and has now spoken to the following organisations in groups of up to 300 people: RAAF 35 SQN, Conrad Gargett Architects, Sunsuper with applications pending for others including TED talks.   
          </p>
          <p>
          Keith is more open about mental illness than most people will be ready for. With that said his experience makes him sensitive of other’s reactions to what might be unpleasant details. He advocates for education by large corporates on the recognition of mental illnesses..
          </p>

          <!-- <h3 class="pb-2">Campers include the following features:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="images/tick-green.png" /> Have you ever heard a person talk about their recovery from multiple mental illnesses?</li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/tick-green.png" /> Have you heard a person talk about their recovery from mental illness and then go on to achieve more success in life than they had before the illnesses?
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/tick-green.png" /> Would you believe that person would also spend their spare time talking to other mentally ill people, transferring lessons learned? Well, that’s my life.
